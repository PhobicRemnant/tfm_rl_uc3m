# Master's Final Proyect in Robotics at the UC3M

This repo contains the code used to train an RL agent that controls the actuator/tooltip point of a robot arm in a mobile manipulator to pour liquids and masses of small solids (like rice), using a research assistencial robot of the UC3M named HEROITEA.

The agent was trained on a simulation environment built in Coppelia Sim, with the usage of the Remote API pluging used in Python.
